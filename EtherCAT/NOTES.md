# Spindle re-tramming - Sat 03 Feb 2024 16:21:56 GMT

240mm diameter

Z axis checked. Perpendicular to table in both axes to within 10um.

Spindle re-trammed, is now square to table by about 5um over 240mm or 0.000020833/1mm (lol)

22mm 3fl endmill should therefore have a deviation of 0.5um (lol again)
